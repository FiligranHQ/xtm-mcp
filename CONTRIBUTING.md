# Contributing to XTM-mcp

Thank you for reading this documentation and considering making your contribution to the project. Any contribution that helps us improve the repository is valuable and much appreciated. If it is also meaningful to you or your organisation it’s all for the best.

In order to help you understand the project, where we are heading and how you can contribute, below are several resources and answers.

Do not hesitate to shoot us an [email](mailto:contact@opencti.io) or join us on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io).


## Why contribute?

XTM-mcp is an open source project aiming at building MCP servers for Filigran's products. If you want to know more about OpenCTI, you can read the [detailed documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/) or try it on the [demonstration platform](https://demo.opencti.io/). If you want to know more about OpenBAS, you can read the [detailed documentation](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/) or try it on the [demonstration platform](https://demo.openbas.io/).

Whether you are an organisation or an individual working or studying in the field of cybersecurity and cyberdefense, or simply as an individual looking for a technical challenge, contributing to the project may represent a great opportunity for you.

* You can help grow the community and tools focused on improving the AI based automation for cyberdefense.

* You will be able to adapt the tool to your core interests and methods of work by developing features or fixing bugs you are most interested in.


## Where is the project heading?

Now that the first version of the tool has been released, our goal for the future releases is two-fold:

* Of course, fix bugs and develop features which are identify as non-critical but would really add-up to MCP capabilities.

* Ease the cross usage of Filigran's tools though MCP capabilities


## Code of Conduct

OpenCTI has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-mcp/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand which actions will and will not be tolerated.


## How can you contribute?

Any contribution is appreciated, and many don’t imply coding. Contributions can range from a suggestion for improving documentation, requesting a new feature, reporting a bug, to developing features or fixing bugs yourself.

For general suggestions or questions about the project or the documentation, you can open an issue on the repository with the label "question". We will answer as soon as possible. If you do not wish to publish on the repository, please see the section below [**"How can you get in touch for other questions?"**](#howcanyougetintouchforotherquestions).

* Just using the tools and opening issues if everything is not working as expected will be a huge step forward. 

* You can look through opened issues and help triage them (ask for more information, suggest workarounds, suggest label, flag issues etc.)
